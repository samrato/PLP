#  COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using data visualization with Plotly. It explores infection rates, deaths, and vaccination progress across several countries.
## Objectives
- Visualize total cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries.
- Identify trends over time in infection and vaccination rates.
- Extract insights from cross-country comparisons.
##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
##  How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
 Insights
The United States reported the highest total number of cases and deaths throughout the observed period.

India showed a sharp increase in vaccination coverage starting around May 2021, coinciding with efforts to curb the second wave.

Kenya maintained relatively lower case numbers but exhibited a consistent trend, possibly due to lower testing or population density differences.

Death rates varied significantly across countries, suggesting disparities in healthcare capacity, public health responses, and population demographics.

Conclusion
This analysis provided a multi-dimensional look at the global COVID-19 situation using data visualization techniques. By exploring confirmed cases, death rates, and vaccination progress across selected countries, we identified clear trends and anomalies:

Countries with stronger healthcare systems and early vaccination rollouts were better equipped to manage outbreaks.

Visualization helped expose patterns not easily seen in raw data, such as post-vaccine surges or regional differences in mortality.

Continued analysis of up-to-date data remains essential to guide future health policy and preparedness.
